Description: The goal of torustest is to provide some practical approaches to perform two-sample goodness-of-fit tests for measures supported on the two-dimensional flat torus based on Wasserstein distance. These techniques have been introduced in González-Delgado, J., González-Sanz, A., Cortés, J., & Neuvial, P. (2021). Two-sample goodness-of-fit tests on the flat torus based on Wasserstein distance and their relevance to structural biology. arXiv:2108.00165.
